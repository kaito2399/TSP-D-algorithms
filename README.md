# Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone
This repository contains algorithms for solving Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D). TSP-D is a new planning problem that combine a truck and a drone to make effective deliveries in the near future. There are several types of heuristics and exact algorithms. Algorithms are coded with Python3. These were used in my research for bachelor's degree at Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2020.
